# car project

This project is a system that simulates the movement of vehicles between intersections and traffic lights.

There are two urban and interurban systems.

This project was done in conjunction with the GUI user interface to give a look at the system.

As well as with a number of design pattern for efficiency and improvement.

And to produce parallelism, I used -threads.

# Technologies:
- Java
- GUI

# Why this project?

This project taught me a lot about using design pattern and using threads.

I also improved in constructing and understanding the subject of object-oriented.
